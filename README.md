Excel transforming toolkit. Which is used to transform data in Excel files (*.xls, *.xlsx)
This is my "pet project", I hope this tools will help our/your job in data analysis be more easier.

This project is not for commercial purposse. If you have some great ideas, please feel free to contact me.
 

**Description:**
This project is an data preprocessing toolkits. The only purpose of this tool is deduce your time on data preprocessing when working with multiple datasource and different data format.
Includes the following features:
+ User can define rules to transform data: row to column, column to row, use Excel function(Ex: left(), right(),..), etc..
+ Input filtering
+ Copy data from one file/sheet to other
+ Define ouput template
+ Export ouput to seperated files
+ Export ouput to standard csv,...
+ Import input from csv, excel(xls, xlsx)
+ Import input from SQL Server
+ Expore/import configuartion file (which will be helpful if you want to share your config to your partners)
+ Email sender (send output file to a pre-defined receiver list)
+ ...and more...

I'm considering some more special tools: apply machine learning and Statistical probability to check if there is something wrong in your data, or use some simple algorithm to pre-process your data.
